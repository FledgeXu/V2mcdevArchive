<p>I know these classes looks like useless for programmers who are experinced. But, as my practice I found that using separate class can help newcomers understand code better. So I will not change it</p>

<p>However, regardless you should explain that these are not versions that should be used and are only there to aid the reader in understanding. You have to remember that the target audience is those with moderate to no experience in Java and that setting them up with bad practices only pushes them towards those in the future. I just rather you give people the ability to succeed with the tools required rather than fail based on bad knowledge even though it's purely visual.</p>

<p>Actually, I will introduce the Data generation in one chapter. I believe if people can not write json by hand and their will not understand the Data generation. Besides, In some case, people still need write json by hand</p>

<p>Actually, there is no case where a JSON should be written by hand. All data can be made into providers and generated manually. My belief is that this is a decent entry-level barrier for those who want to get started in modding. It teaches people that they need a decently moderate level of understanding within Java to be able to mod it correctly. It will discourage those who think they can do it with no Java knowledge and entice them to take the time to learn before getting started. This is how I've been approaching my rewrite of the text tutorial explanations. We're not trying to cater to all audiences, just those who have the determination to see this through to the end regardless of the starting point. Making it seem easy to start and pick up in useful, but with little moderation to know there are standards.<br>
